            We have developed a video annotation tool on Knowledge Forum. In this research, we assumed qualitative
            analysis in the educational field research as Knowledge Building activity.The annotation tool is designed
            how we can support the collaborative video analysis using Knowledge Forum(KF).
        </p>
        <p>
            The tool has a simple interface. A user can make annotations to the attached video on Knowledge Forum.
            As these annotations are stored as Knowledge Forum notes, each annotation note can be used as an
            operational knowledge piece. Therefore annotations have avility to be built on a new idea note.

            By using this functionality, a demonstaration analysis was conducted using the process of 1st year grade
            girls learning programming in our programming workshop for kids. The length of the video is about 3 minutes.
            Three university students as reserchers tried to make annotations for the video. The goal of this analysis
            was to write a short paper about the programming process, so they started to create notes which shows
            learners finding by using the created annotations. Notes are created as findings of the learning
            process using annotations. Finally the student tried to create the note which shows whole story of the
            girl's learning process using annotations.
