    Then you can put a comment here -- For example, Kids are seriously thinking.
    And press button, and then you can make an annotation note on the view, as a builds-on note from the video
    contribution.

    The title of the note shows the time in the video and a comment which the user input.
    Then you can click to open an annotation note, and play the video when the time the user set.

    By using this functionality, my student created a demonstration analysis.
    Here is the video, which is recorded the process of 1st year grade girls learning programming in our programming
    workshop for kids. The length is about 3 minutes. Three university students in my lab tried to make annotations for
    this
    video.
    Now there is no useful functionality to sort these notes by time, so they manually sorted these annotations.

    The goal of this analysis was to write a short paper about the programming process, so they started to create notes
    which shows learners finding by using the created annotations. I am sorry this is conducted in Japanese, but you can
    find the notes by seeing references. These notes are created as findings of the learning process using annotations.

    Finally the student tried to create the note which shows whole story of the girl's learning process using
    annotations.
    Here is the note. By click each references, the user can see the scene the annotation tagged.

    One of the next step is to produce the highlight videos using this story note. That's fantastic if we can see the
    other
    information such as KBDeX network structure in the side of the video.

    Thank you very much.
